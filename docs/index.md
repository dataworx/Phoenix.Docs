# Phoenix.Docs Documentation

The goal of Phoenix.Docs is to provide an easy and convenient way to publish your project documentation. 

The most annoying but not the least important part of any project is providing comprehensive documentation. Even if you have 
well-written documentation, it needs to be published in a form that customers can easily use. Otherwise it becomes useless. 
This is where Phoenix.Docs comes into play. 

The main purpose is to publish the documentation and provide additional functionality for the users. This should be possible without 
hindering you in creating the documentation. There are only two requirements. 
Write your documentation in Markdown and create a single simple configuration file.

## tbd...

- Document the publish workflow
- Document the config file format
- Document the source providers
- Document the hosting workflow
- Create a roadmap
- Add a changelog as part of the documentation
